# WiiYii HUD Companion App ‚Äì Navigation Extension Repo

The **WiiYii HUD Companion App** is an **unofficial companion application** for **WiiYii Smart HUD** devices.  
It connects to WiiYii head-up display (HUD) units via **Bluetooth**, transmitting **real-time navigation data** from your phone directly to your car‚Äôs HUD ‚Äî so you can drive safely with directions always in view.

This repository contains the **open-source plugin and extension framework** that powers the app‚Äôs navigation integrations.

---

## üß≠ About the App

The app uses your existing **Google Maps navigation** ‚Äî meaning there‚Äôs **no need for a separate navigation system**.  
However, its plugin-based design allows developers to add **support for additional navigation services**, such as:

- üó∫Ô∏è **MapBox**
- üöó **Waze**
- üåè **Here WeGo**
- üß≠ **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** and others

---

## üîå Plugin / Extension System

The app is designed with a **modular plugin architecture**.  
Each plugin acts as a bridge between a navigation provider and the WiiYii HUD display protocol.

### Plugin Responsibilities

A plugin should:
1. Receive navigation data (e.g., direction, distance, ETA, street name).
2. Format and send this data to the main app via the plugin API.
3. Allow the app to forward it to the connected HUD device over Bluetooth.

Plugins can be built in **.NET (C#)** as independent assemblies and loaded dynamically at runtime.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Plugin Development Guide

### Requirements
- .NET 9.0 (or higher)
- .NET MAUI

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AvaShieldAdmin/WiiYiiHudNavigator.git
   ```

2. Create a new plugin project (e.g., `WiiYiiHudNavigator.Plugin.Waze`).

   **Important:** The DLL name must follow the format `WiiYiiHudNavigator.Plugin.*.dll` for the app to detect it.
   
   - **Recommended:** Name your project following the pattern `WiiYiiHudNavigator.Plugin.YourProviderName`
   - **Alternative:** Use the `<AssemblyName>` property in your `.csproj` file:
     ```xml
     <PropertyGroup>
       <AssemblyName>WiiYiiHudNavigator.Plugin.YourProviderName</AssemblyName>
     </PropertyGroup>
     ```

3. **Implement the required interfaces:**

   Your plugin **must implement** both `INavigationIntegrationSetup` and `INavigationIntegrationInterface`:

   ```csharp
    public interface INavigationIntegrationSetup
    {
	    Guid Id { get; }
	    void SetupServices(MauiAppBuilder builder, IServiceCollection services);
	    StartNavigationIntegrationButton GetStartNavigationButton();
	    INavigationIntegrationInterface GetInterface();
	    void OnAppLoaded(IServiceProvider serviceProvider);
    }

    public interface INavigationIntegrationInterface
    {
	    INavigationIntegrationSetup Setup { get; }
	    ContentView? GetNavigationUiContent();
	    void OnAppLoaded();
	    void OnAppUnloaded();
    }
   ```

   **About `StartNavigationIntegrationButton`:**
   - `Title`: The main display name for your navigation integration
   - `ShortDescription`: A brief description shown to users
   - `IconFile`: Filename of the icon (must be included in your plugin's resources)
   - `PriceTagTitle`: Optional pricing information (e.g., "Free", "Premium", "In-App Purchase")

4. Build and test your plugin with the main app.

5. Submit a **Pull Request** to share your plugin with the community!

## üêõ Debugging Your Plugin on Android

To test your plugin on Android devices during development:

1. **Build your plugin DLL** from your plugin project.

2. **Copy all DLL files** to the device at:
   ```
   /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.avashield.wiiyiihudnavigator/files/DebugIntegrations
   ```
   
   Create the `DebugIntegrations` folder if it doesn't exist.

   **Using ADB command:**
   ```bash
   adb push path/to/your/WiiYiiHudNavigator.Plugin.YourPlugin.dll /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.avashield.wiiyiihudnavigator/files/DebugIntegrations/
   ```

3. **Close the WiiYii HUD app** completely and reopen it.

4. **Enable debug mode:**
   - Navigate to the "Start Navigation Options" section
   - **Press and hold for 3 seconds** on any icon in the section
   - A debug menu will appear

5. **Enable your plugin:**
   - Check the checkbox next to your plugin's DLL
   - Tap **"Save Changes"**

6. **Restart the app** again.

7. **Verify:** If all goes well, you'll see your plugin's button in the navigation options.

## üì° Communication Protocol

The app communicates with WiiYii HUD devices via Bluetooth.

Each plugin can update the HUD in real time by using the shared `IHudConnection` interface, which is registered in the dependency injection container.

Inject it into your class as follows:

```csharp
public class MyNavigationIntegration : INavigationIntegrationInterface
{
    private readonly IHudConnection _hud;

    public MyNavigationIntegration(IHudConnection hud)
    {
        _hud = hud;
    }

    public async Task SendUpdateAsync(NavigationData data)
    {
        var hudData = new HudNavigationData
        {
            Direction = data.Direction,
            DistanceToTurn = data.Distance,
            StreetName = data.Street,
            Eta = data.Eta,
            Speed = data.Speed
        };

        await _hud.UpdateNavigationData(hudData);
    }

    public void Clear()
    {
        _hud.NoNavigationData();
    }
}
```

### Interface Definition

```csharp
public interface IHudConnection
{
    void NoNavigationData();
    Task UpdateNavigationData(HudNavigationData navigationData, bool hasNoChange = false);
}
```

Use `UpdateNavigationData()` whenever your plugin has new navigation info to send to the HUD,
and call `NoNavigationData()` when no route is active.

## üß† Example: Waze Plugin Concept

A Waze integration could:

* Listen for Android **Intent broadcasts** from Waze (for next-turn info)
* Parse direction, street name, and ETA
* Convert to `HudNavigationData`
* Update the HUD via `IHudConnection`

This allows real-time Waze navigation to appear on the WiiYii HUD, just like with Google Maps.
